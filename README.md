## Greatest Estate Gallery
An attempt to clone a random real estate website built using [HTMX](https://htmx.org/docs), Golang and Tailwind CSS  
  
Website deployed [here](https://greatest-estate-gallery.onrender.com/)
### Objectives
- Practice frontend development using Tailwind, and achieve a responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Incorporate HTMX into an application serving content from an endpoint
- Write more lines of Golang
- Automate build and deploy of a Golang application through the use of Github Actions and Dockerhub

### Insights
- [Render hosting](https://render.com/) provides a free solution where it isn't necessary to input credit card details to deploy an application, they provide multiple deployment options, this project opts for the Dockerhub image deployment service
- [Pushing to a Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-docker-images) is not rocket science
- Github actions include triggers for a [bunch of things](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows)
- CDNs are amazing, [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) is a great CMS, it isn't necessary or even easier to customize a site through WordPress
- HTML is great, [Golang Templating](https://docs.gofiber.io/template/html/TEMPLATES_CHEATSHEET/#nested-templates-and-layouts) is great

### Next Steps
- Learn more about HTMX and how to incorporate it with real-world or at the very least real-world imitating APIs
- Learn enough about Golang to be able to tackle a bunch of applications with it
- Learn more about GitHub Workflows
